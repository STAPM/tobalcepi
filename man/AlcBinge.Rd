\title{Calculate variables to inform alcohol binge model}
\usage{
AlcBinge(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data table of individual characteristics.}
}
\value{
Returns data plus the estimated variables.
}
\description{
Uses survey data and previously estimated coefficients to describe
the patterns of single occassion drinking.
}
\details{
This is based on a study by Hill-McManus 2014,
who analysed drinking occasions using data from detailed diaries in the National Diet and Nutrition Survey 2000/2001.
Using the results, it possible to model each individual's expected number of drinking occasions across the year,
the average amount they drunk on an occasion, the variability in the amount drunk among occasions,
and how these vary socio-demographically.
