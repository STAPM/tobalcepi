To illustrate the use of the `tobalcepi` functions for different tasks, we have created example workflows. You can use these examples to help understand how the code works, run them to generate model inputs, or use them as a starting point for the development of a new project.    

At the moment, these workflows are accessible only to the project team. To access them, you will need to be added to the STAPM Gitlab organisation.  

The workflows are listed below:  

- [Smoking and the risks of adult diseases report](https://gitlab.com/stapm/model-inputs/epi_tobacco_risk). A working Rmarkdown version of the published report.       
- [Alcohol-attributable diseases and dose-response curves report](https://gitlab.com/stapm/model-inputs/epi_alcohol_risk). A working Rmarkdown version of the published report.       
- [Population attributable fractions](https://gitlab.com/stapm/model-inputs/epi_pop_attrib_fractions). Working repo for our main project on the fractions of disease attributable to tobacco and/or alcohol.       
- [Irish alcohol attributable fractions](https://gitlab.com/stapm/projects/irish-aafsr). A consultancy project in which we adapted the code in `tobalcepi` to suit alcohol survey data from Ireland.
