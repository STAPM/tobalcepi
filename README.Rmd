[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)  

**DRAFT WORKING VERSION** - The package is usable but there are still bugs and further developments that are being worked through i.e. some code and documentation is still incomplete or in need of being refined. The code and documentation are still undergoing internal review by the analyst team.   

## Motivation
`tobalcepi` was created as part of a programme of work on the health economics of tobacco and alcohol at the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), The University of Sheffield. This programme is based around the construction of the Sheffield Tobacco and Alcohol Policy Model (STAPM), which aims to use comparable methodologies to evaluate the impacts of tobacco and alcohol policies, and investigate the consequences of clustering and interactions between tobacco and alcohol consumption behaviours.   

The motivation for `tobalcepi` was to organise the information on the relative risks of diseases in adults related to their own tobacco and alcohol consumption and to provide functions to easily work with these data in modelling. The suite of functions within `tobalcepi` processes the published data on disease risks that stem from chronic and acute alcohol consumption, from smoking, and on the decline in risk after ceasing or reducing consumption. The package also includes functions to estimate population attributable fractions, and to explore the interaction between the disease risks that stem from tobacco and alcohol consumption.     

 > The disease lists and risk functions in this package all have published sources, which we have referenced. In order to obtain mathematical descriptions of the risk functions for use in modelling, we needed to contact some authors to ask for addition information.  

## Usage

`tobalcepi` is a package for predicting individual risk of disease due to tobacco and alcohol consumption based on published sources, and summarising that risk.    

The **inputs** are the published estimates of relative risk for each disease (sometimes stratified by population subgroup).   

The **processes** applied by the functions in `tobalcepi` give options to estimate:

1. The risk of injury or disease from acute alcohol consumption.  
1. The risk of chronic disease based on the current amount of alcohol consumed.   
1. The risk of chronic disease based on whether someone currently smokes, and how much they currently smoke.   
1. The combined risk of disease in someone who smokes and drinks.  
1. The change in risk of disease after someone ceases or reduces their consumption.  
1. The population attributable fractions of disease to tobacco and/or alcohol (given suitable data on tobacco and alcohol consumption).   

The **outputs** of these processes are datasets in which an individual's tobacco and/or alcohol consumption has been matched to their relative risks of certain diseases, and aggregated datasets that summarise the risks of disease within certain population subgroups.      

## Installation
`tobalcepi` is currently available only to members of the project team (but please contact Duncan Gillespie duncan.gillespie@sheffield.ac.uk to discuss). To access you need to [**sign-up for a GitLab account**](https://gitlab.com/). You will then need to be added to the STAPM project team to gain access.   

Once that is sorted, you can **install the development version** from GitLab with:     

```{r gh_installation, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("devtools")
#install.packages("getPass")

devtools::install_git(
  "https://gitlab.com/stapm/tobalcepi.git", 
  credentials = git2r::cred_user_pass("uname", getPass::getPass()),
  ref = "x.x.x",
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)

# Where uname is your Gitlab user name.
# ref = "x.x.x" is the version to install - remove this to install the latest version
# this should make a box pop up where you enter your GitLab password
```

Then load the package, and some other packages that are useful. Note that the code within `tobalcepi` uses the `data.table::data.table()` syntax.  

```{r pkgs, eval = F}
# Load the package
library(tobalcepi)

# Other useful packages
library(dplyr) # for data manipulation and summary
library(magrittr) # for pipes
library(ggplot2) # for plotting
```
