\value{
Two data tables are returned:
\itemize{
\item "data_plus_rr" is a version of "data" with added columns that give each
individual's relative risk for each disease.

\description{
This function takes a sample of individuals and computes each individual's relative risk
for each disease according to their current tobacco and alcohol consumption. 
There is an option to tailor this
to the alcohol only, tobacco only, or joint tobacco and alcohol contexts.
}
\details{
See below
}
\section{Alcohol risk}{

For alcohol, the relative risk for each individual for each disease is calculated based on 
their average weekly alcohol consumption (using \code{\link{RRalc}}). 
Alcohol consumption is converted to grams of ethanal consumed on average in a day, and 
this is truncated at 150g/day. We assume 8 grams of ethanol per UK standard unit of alcohol. 
 For diseases that have separate mortality and morbidity risk functions, 
 separate variables are created containing
 the relative risks for each for the same disease.
Unlike tobacco, there is no "former drinker" state in our alcohol modelling, meaning that 
individuals are not recorded as being former drinkers -- 
instead their alcohol consumption just falls to zero and their
relative risk for disease changes accordingly.
}

\section{Alcohol lags}{

To account for the lagged effects of changes to the amount that individuals drink on their
current risk of disease, 
it is necessary to add memory to our modelling, 
which we do in this function by storing each individual's 
past trajectory of the relative risk that they were assigned 
for each disease. Doing so adds extra computations and makes the model run a bit slower. 
In each year of the simulation, the current relative risk of an individual is 
adjusted to take account of 
each individual's stored drinking histories. 
This adjustment takes the form of a weighted average of current and past relative risk, 
where the weights are proportional to
the disease-specific lag function (which comes from \code{\link{AlcLags}}). 
This method is slightly different to the method that was developed for SAPM, 
as it needed to be adapted to suit the modelling of individual life-course 
trajectories of alcohol consumption.
}

\section{Tobacco risk}{

For tobacco, the relative risk for each individual is calculated based on whether 
they are a current, former or never smoker (using \code{\link{RRtob}}).
Currently, all current smokers have the same relative risk regardless of 
the amount they currently smoke or have smoked in the past (but we are in the process 
of developing inputs and a function to take account of dose-response effects of 
the amount currently smoked using \code{\link{RRTobDR}}).
}

\section{Tobacco lags}{

Former smokers are initially given the relative risk associated with current smokers (using \code{\link{RRtob}}), 
which we then scale according to a disease-specific
function that describes how risk declines after quitting smoking (which comes from \code{\link{TobLags}}). 
After 40 years from quitting, we assume that risk has reached the level of a never smoker.
}

\section{Joint alcohol and tobacco risk}{

If both tobacco and alcohol are being considered in a joint model,
we combine the relative risks for current drinkers and smokers. 
In implementing this combination of risks, we have built-in the option 
to take account of synergistic effects (i.e. when the combined 
risk from tobacco and alcohol consumption is more that would be expected 
from the additive combination of risks, because for some conditions that 
tobacco and alcohol consumption interact physiologically, and that interaction 
further increases disease risk). 
We currently include estimates of synergistic effects for 
oral, pharyngeal, laryngeal and oesophageal cancers. 
We apply these effects using \code{\link{TobAlcInt}} by scaling the joint risks by a 'synergy index', 
which takes the result of a meta-analysis of the additional
risk faced by people because they consume both tobacco and alcohol.
