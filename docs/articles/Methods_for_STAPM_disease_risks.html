<h2 id="background">Background<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#background"></a>
</h2>
<p>Tobacco and alcohol are leading causes of preventable disease and of
socio-demographic inequalities in health and there is a great deal of
literature that reports estimates of the relationship between tobacco or
alcohol consumption and the risk of having or dying from a wide range of
conditions. There is less information available to estimate how tobacco
and alcohol consumption might combine to influence disease risk, and so
for STAPM we needed to collate and understand the available
information.</p>
<p>This vignette describes how we use the relative risks of disease in
STAPM, written as a guide to help understand the functions in the
tobalcepi package.</p>

</h3>
<p>To organise the information on the relative risks of diseases due to
tobacco and alcohol consumption, and to provide functions to easily work
with these data in modelling, we built the <a href="https://stapm.github.io/tobalcepi/">tobalcepi R code package</a>
(click on the link to the package webpage for introductory information).
The R code functions are version controlled so that each project works
with a specified version of the package (see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xEMhnUMXgeXbeBQtqM_yCjJ9jC6f9j4QLMFX6SToJOo/edit#gid=0" class="external-link">version
tracking sheet</a>), and error-fixes and new developments can be tracked
(see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mc6FjiwHgW4vvGs62SgYpAZrPXcqWBCpltBLZeTd8V4/edit#gid=0" class="external-link">issues

<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/RRFunc.html">tobalcepi::RRFunc()</a></code> does the job of
assigning the relative risks of each disease to a sample of individuals
according to their current alcohol and/or tobacco consumption status.
<code><a href="../reference/RRFunc.html">tobalcepi::RRFunc()</a></code> has options that can tailor it to
assign risks based on tobacco consumption only, alcohol consumption
only, or both tobacco and alcohol consumption.</p>

<p>To illustrate the use of the <code>tobalcepi</code> functions for

<p>See the alcohol and disease risks report <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Angus2018" role="doc-biblioref">Angus et al.
2018</a>)</span>. The alcohol modelling considers 45 categories of adult
diseases related to alcohol consumption and the corresponding
dose-response effects of current levels of alcohol consumption on the
relative risks of disease. The model links average weekly alcohol
consumption to the risk of chronic diseases, and the amount of alcohol
consumed on single drinking occasions to health harms associated with
intoxication.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="partial-acute-alcohol-risk-functions">“Partial acute” alcohol risk functions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#partial-acute-alcohol-risk-functions"></a>
</h3>
<p>Here we describe the approach taken in STAPM to model the health
harms that are partially-attributable to level of acute alcohol intake
on a single occasion (i.e. related to intoxication). The health harms
that we consider could be intentional or unintentional, e.g. traffic
accidents, assault or falls. “Partially-attributable acute” means that
the harm can occur without alcohol but the risk of occurrence changes
with intoxication.</p>
<p>We build on the method used to model the health harms due to
intoxication in the Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model (SAPM). The methods
used for this module of SAPM have evolved over time. Originally, the
risk of harm was inferred from external information on the alcohol
attributable fractions of traffic accidents, assaults, falls etc.
(described in the Purshouse et al. modelling report for NICE <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-purshouse2009nice" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>). The method was updated to allow
SAPM to model individual exposure to the risk of harm from each drinking
occasion, e.g. for how long is someone intoxicated after drinking and
what is their risk of a fall injury when intoxicated – this new method
is described in two papers by Hill-McManus et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hill2014estimation" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>; <a href="#ref-Hill-McManus2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Most recently, the method was
updated to incorporate new estimates of the risk of health harms due to
intoxication by Cherpitel et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cherpitel2015relative" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>
– these are described in the alcohol risk functions report <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Angus2018" role="doc-biblioref">Angus et
al. 2018</a>)</span>.</p>

<h5 id="number-of-drinking-occassions">Number of drinking occassions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#number-of-drinking-occassions"></a>
</h5>
<p>The first step is to estimate the number of drinking occasions that
an individual has in a year and we have two sources of information on
this.</p>
<p><em>Source of information 1</em>. The HSE asks repondents about the
frequency they drank alcoholic drinks in the last 12 months (in the
variable <code>dnoft</code>), offering the responses: Almost every day,
Five or six days a week, Three or four days a week, Once or twice a
week, Once or twice a month, Once every couple of months, Once or twice
a year. For interval frequencies, we take the mid point value. We
convert yearly frequencies to weekly frequency. For example, Three or
four days a week becomes 3.5 times a week. This processing is done by
the function <code><a href="https://stapm.github.io/hseclean/reference/alc_drink_now_allages.html" class="external-link">hseclean::alc_drink_now_allages()</a></code> that calls
the function <code><a href="https://stapm.github.io/hseclean/reference/alc_drink_freq.html" class="external-link">hseclean::alc_drink_freq()</a></code>.</p>
<p><em>Source of information 2</em>. Hill-McManus et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hill2014estimation" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> developed a method to estimate the
number of drinking occasions per year using data from detailed diaries
in the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) 2000/2001. Using the
regression coefficients from this study, it is possible to predict each
individual’s expected number of drinking occasions across the year, the
average amount they drunk on an occasion, the variability in the amount
drunk among occasions, and how these vary socio-demographically.
Hill-McManus et al. use a negative binomial regression model for the
number of weekly drinking occasions (see their Table 3). The explanatory
variables for the number of weekly drinking occasions were: log weekly
mean consumption, age, income (in poverty or not), ethnicity
(white/non-white), age left education, number of children, social class
(manual/non-manual). From the regression coefficients we calculate the
expected number of weekly drinking occasions for each individual in the
HSE data (implemented in the STAPM code by the function
<code><a href="../reference/AlcBinge.html">tobalcepi::AlcBinge()</a></code>). Note that this model was fitted to
a population sample aged below 65 years, but we assume the effect at
55–65 years applies at older ages too.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="amount-drunk-on-drinking-occasions">Amount drunk on drinking occasions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#amount-drunk-on-drinking-occasions"></a>
</h5>
<p>The second step is to estimate the distribution of the amounts that
each individual drinks on their drinking occasions. The HSE does not
provide this information – it asks questions on the number of units that
each individual drank on their heaviest drinking day in the last seven
days but this does not tell us about the distribution of amounts drunk
across all drinking occasions in a year.</p>
<p>SAPM uses the method developed by Hill-McManus et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hill2014estimation" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> – there are two parts to the
process of estimating the distribution of amount drunk.</p>
<p>First, estimate the average quantity of alcohol that we expect each
individual to consume on a drinking occasion. Hill-McManus et
al. estimated regression coefficients (their Table 4) that allow
predictions of the average amount consumed. The predictors of average
amount consumed were: log weekly mean consumption, age, sex, ethnicity
(non-white/white), and an interaction between sex and log weekly mean
consumption (indicating that men and women differ in the number of
drinking occasions required to achieve the same level of weekly
consumption). Note that an estimate of the average quantity of alcohol
consumed on a drinking occasion can also be obtained from the HSE data
by dividing average weekly consumption by the number of weekly drinking
occasions.</p>
<p>Second, estimate the individual-level variability in the amount
consumed across their drinking occasions. To do this, Hill-McManus et
al. fitted two Heckman regression models to the NDNS data:</p>
<p><em>Model 1</em> was a Heckman selection model designed to correct
the analysis for the problem that the NDNS data only provides a
seven-day snapshot of each individual’s annual drinking, and at least
three data points per individual are needed to estimate the variability
in amount drunk. The Heckman selection model estimated the probability
that an individual drank on at least three separate occasions during the
diary period (see their Table 5). The results were used to correct the
estimates of variability for selection bias via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mills_ratio#Inverse_Mills_ratio" class="external-link">Inverse
Mills Ratio</a>. The predictors of an individual drinking on at least
three separate occasions during the diary period were: log weekly mean
consumption, age, income (in poverty or not), employed/not-employed,
ethnicity (non-white/white), age left education, number of children,
social class (manual/non-manual).</p>
<p><em>Model 2</em> was a Heckman outcome regression fitted to the
standard deviation of the quantity of alcohol consumed in a drinking
occasion (see their Table 6). The predictors of the standard deviation
in the quantity of alcohol consumed in a drinking occasion were: log
weekly mean consumption, income (in poverty or not), and the Inverse
Mills ratio.</p>
<p>In the STAPM code, the function <code><a href="../reference/AlcBinge.html">tobalcepi::AlcBinge()</a></code>
uses the HSE data and the regression coefficients from Hill-McManus et
al. to infer the mean and standard deviation of amount drunk on each
drinking occasion by individuals who drink. From these two parameters,
we then calculate individual-specific probability density functions of
the amount of alcohol consumed on a drinking occasion (in the STAPM
code, this is done within the function
<code><a href="../reference/PArisk.html">tobalcepi::PArisk()</a></code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="time-spent-intoxicated">Time spent intoxicated<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#time-spent-intoxicated"></a>
</h5>
<p>The third step is to estimate each individual’s annual exposure to
the risk of health harms due to intoxication, as defined by the amount
of time that they spend intoxicated during a year (here we use
‘intoxicated’ to mean having a percentage blood alcohol content (%BAC)
greater than zero). The method that we use to estimate the time that
each individual spends intoxicated over a year is described in
Hill-McManus et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Hill-McManus2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, who
drew on Taylor et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-taylor2011combining" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The expected duration of intoxication for each amount of alcohol
drunk on an occassion is defined in terms of the time, in hours, after a
drinking occasion that it would take for an individual’s %BAC to drop to
zero. The calculation of this time considers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an individual’s sex, height and weight;</p></li>
<li><p>Widmark’s <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> (the fraction of
the body mass in which alcohol would be present if it were distributed
at concentrations equal to that in blood - see examples of use of the
Widmark equation in Watson <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-watson1981prediction" role="doc-biblioref">1981</a>)</span>
and Posey and Mozayani <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Posey2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>);</p></li>
<li><p>the rate at which the liver clears alcohol from the body (we
assume this is 0.017 %BAC per hour).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To simplify the calculation, we do not consider the rate of alcohol
absorption (i.e. there is no alcohol absorption rate constant) or the
time interval between drinks within a drinking occasion.</p>
<p>The calculation of the time that each individual spends intoxicated
in a year multiplies the probability that each level of alcohol is
consumed on a drinking occasion by the expected duration of intoxication
for each amount of alcohol that could be drunk on an occasion. This is
then multiplied by the expected number of drinking occasions per week
and by 52 weeks in a year. Finally, the time spent intoxicated is summed
to give the expected time spent intoxicated in a year (in the STAPM
code, this is implemented by the function
<code><a href="../reference/PArisk.html">tobalcepi::PArisk()</a></code>).</p>

conditions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-annual-relative-risk-of-partially-attributable-acute-conditions"></a>
</h5>
<p>The relative risks for alcohol-related injuries are taken from
Cherpitel et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cherpitel2015relative" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>
and described in our alcohol risk functions report <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Angus2018" role="doc-biblioref">Angus et
al. 2018</a>)</span>. Note that Cherpitel et al. report relative risks
by the number of standard drinks consumed (we assume 1 Std. drink = 16ml
(12.8g) of ethanol). The risk functions in Cherpital differ by four
causes of health harm, which we map onto our disease list as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traffic<br>
</li>
<li>Violence: “Assault”, “Other_intentional_injuries”<br>
</li>
<li>Falls<br>
</li>
<li>Other: “Mechanical_forces”, “Drowning”,
“Other_unintentional_injuries”, “intentional_self_harm”,
“Accidental_poisoning”, “Fire_injuries”.</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate the annual relative risk for each condition, we do the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>match each amount drunk on a drinking occasion to the associated
relative risk (e.g. the relative risk of violence after a drinking
occasion where 6 standard drinks were consumed);</p></li>
<li><p>multiply the relative risk associated with each drinking occasion
by the expected amount of time spent intoxicated following that drinking
occasion;</p></li>
<li><p>sum the relative risk associated with the time during the year
that is spent intoxicated (the remaining time in the year that is not
spent intoxicated has a relative risk of 1).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The final estimate of each individual’s annual relative risk of a
partially-attributable acute condition is the average risk considering
time spent intoxicated and time not spent intoxicated (in the STAPM code
the calculations are implemented by the function
<code><a href="../reference/PArisk.html">tobalcepi::PArisk()</a></code>).</p>

<h5 id="adaptation-to-suit-stapm">Adaptation to suit STAPM<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adaptation-to-suit-stapm"></a>
</h5>
<p><em>The problem</em><br>
STAPM uses a different method of modelling to SAPM in that STAPM tracks
individuals as they age (the within-cohort dynamics) but SAPM does not –
instead SAPM models changes over time (in one-year time steps) to
repeated cross-sectional samples of individuals from the HSE. The method
described above is easily applied to a sample of individuals from the
HSE (the SAPM method), because the HSE contains the necessary covariate
(i.e. in the HSE sample there is also data on ethnicity, income, number
of children etc.). For STAPM to use the method, would require it to also
track the individual age trajectories of traits such as income – and
this is beyond the current scope of the STAPM modelling.</p>
<p><em>The solution</em><br>
The STAPM modelling tracks the individual age trajectories of the
average weekly amount of alcohol consumed – the dynamics of these
trajectories are stratified by sex and Index of Multiple Deprivation
(IMD) quintiles. We therefore need to adapt the method to predict the
number of drinking occasions and the distribution of amount consumed as
a function of the average weekly amount of alcohol consumed, age, sex
and IMD quintile. The simplest way to do this is to assign the parameter
values from Hill-McManus et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hill2014estimation" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> to
each individual in a sample of the HSE, and then to average these values
by age, sex and IMD quintile (the IMD quintile averages will then
reflect the variation among IMD quintiles in the distribution of
ethnicity, income, number of children etc.).</p>
<p><em>Implementing in the STAPM code</em><br>
The code to average the parameter values from Hill-McManus et al is in
the folder <code>data-raw/binge_params</code> within the
<code>tobalcepi</code> package. This code also averages individual
height and weight by age, sex and IMD quintile, for use in the
calculations of time spent intoxicated. A new function
<code><a href="../reference/AlcBinge_stapm.html">tobalcepi::AlcBinge_stapm()</a></code> has been written to implement
the calculations using these averaged parameter values. The functions
<code>tobalcepi::RRAlc()</code> and <code><a href="../reference/PArisk.html">tobalcepi::PArisk()</a></code>
have also had minor edits so that they work with the

<p>Here we describe the approach taken in STAPM to model the chronic

“Wholly-attributable” means that these conditions cannot occur without
alcohol (i.e. all cases are due to alcohol consumption).</p>

<p>We build on the method used to model the chronic health harms that
are wholly-attributable to alcohol in the Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model
(SAPM). The main issue is that there is minimal available evidence on
the relationship between the level of long-term alcohol consumption and
the risk of chronic harms that were wholly attributable to alcohol.
Assumptions are therefore needed about the shape of the risk function
that links alcohol consumption to the risk of wholly alcohol
attributable chronic conditions (the approach taken is described on page

</h3>
<p>Here we describe the approach taken in STAPM to model the health
harms that are wholly-attributable to level of acute alcohol intake on a
single occasion. The health harms that we consider in this category are
conditions associated with the effects of excessive blood level of
alcohol, toxic effects of alcohol, alcohol poisoning, and acute
intoxication. “Wholly-attributable acute” means that these conditions
cannot occur without alcohol (i.e. all cases are due to alcohol
consumption) and the risk of these conditions changes with acute
exposure to alcohol.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="the-sapm-method-1">The SAPM method<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-sapm-method-1"></a>
</h4>
<p>We build on the method used to model the acute health harms that are
wholly-attributable to alcohol in the Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model
(SAPM).</p>
<p>The main issue to be overcome in the development of SAPM was that
there was no available evidence on the relationship between the level of
acute exposure to alcohol within a single drinking occasion and the risk
of acute harms that were wholly attributable to this acute exposure.
Assumptions therefore needed to be made about the shape of the risk
function that links the level of single occasion drinking to the risk of
acute harms (the approach taken is described on page 29 in the Purshouse
et al. modelling report for NICE <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-purshouse2009nice" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>In addition, due to the harms being wholly-attributable to alcohol,
no cases are expected in people who consume below a certain threshold of
alcohol on a single occasion, i.e. there are no cases in the non-exposed
reference group. One of the consequences of this is that it is not
possible to calculate relative risk; instead, the relationship between
single occasion drinking and acute harm must be represented by an
absolute risk function, e.g. in terms of the expected number of deaths
or hospitalisations if a certain number of people were to drink a
certain number of units of alcohol on a single occasion. Figure 1 shows
the shape of the risk function currently used in SAPM.</p>

<p><em>The problem</em><br>
The main difference between SAPM and STAPM is that STAPM simulates the
individual life-course dynamics of the average weekly amount of alcohol
consumed - STAPM does not simulate the dynamics of the amount drunk on
the heaviest drinking day. This means that for STAPM, we need to develop
a method to link the risk of acute harms that are wholly-attributable to
alcohol consumption to average weekly alcohol consumption.</p>
<p><em>The solution</em><br>
The solution is to draw on the methods for partially attributable acute
conditions, which uses parameter values from Hill-McManus et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hill2014estimation" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> to infer the characteristics of
single occasion drinking from average weekly alcohol consumption and a
range of individual-level covariates. Using the method in
<code><a href="../reference/AlcBinge_stapm.html">tobalcepi::AlcBinge_stapm()</a></code> we can calculate the average
parameter values by age, sex and IMD quintile. Using these parameter
values, we can translate each individual’s average weekly alcohol
consumption to their expected number of weekly drinking occasions, and
the distribution of the amounts that each individual drinks on their
drinking occasions. For each individual, we can then calculate the total
number of units per year that are drunk after each individual has
already exceeded the single occasion drinking thresholds of 4 units/day
for men and 3 units/day for women.</p>
<p><em>Implementing in the STAPM code</em><br>
A new function <code><a href="../reference/WArisk_acute.html">tobalcepi::WArisk_acute()</a></code> has been created
to calculate the total number of units that each individual is expected
to drink above the single ocassion binge drinking thresholds. This
function is called from within the function
<code><a href="../reference/RRalc.html">tobalcepi::RRalc()</a></code> and uses the parameters outputs by
<code><a href="../reference/AlcBinge_stapm.html">tobalcepi::AlcBinge_stapm()</a></code>.</p>

</h2>
<p>See the smoking and disease risks report <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Webster2018" role="doc-biblioref">Webster et al.
2018</a>)</span>. The Sheffield Tobacco Policy Model (STPM) considers 52
adult diseases related to smoking and the corresponding relative risks
of developing these diseases in current vs. never smokers, and in former
smokers according to the time since they quit. The first step carried
out by <code><a href="../reference/RRFunc.html">tobalcepi::RRFunc()</a></code> is to assign both current and
former smokers the relative risk for each disease associated with
current smoking. It does this using the function
<code>tobalcepi::RRTob()</code>.</p>
<p>For current smokers, the current version of the modelling assumes
that the relative risks of disease are the same for all smokers
regardless of the amount currently smoked and the length of time as a
smoker, although we have begun to review and incorporate available
dose-response risk functions for smoking (the function
<code><a href="../reference/RRTobDR.html">tobalcepi::RRTobDR()</a></code> estimates each individual in the data
their dose-response relative risk based on the number of cigarettes they
consume per day). STPM is also currently limited to the consideration of
diseases that affect the consumer themselves e.g. excluding secondary
effects of smoking.</p>
<p>We arrived at the list of tobacco related diseases used in STPM
through a process of reviewing the diseases considered by previous
health economic models of smoking, and reviewing reports and papers that
reviewed the disease risks of smoking <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Pokhrel2013" role="doc-biblioref">Pokhrel et al. 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-Callum2004" role="doc-biblioref">Callum and White 2004</a>;

involvement in Chapter 2 of the RCP report ‘Hiding in plain sight’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-RCP2018" role="doc-biblioref">Tobacco
Advisory Group of the Royal College of Physicians 2018</a>)</span>. We
were further influenced by discussions within our research group
relating to updates to the list of diseases related to alcohol, their
ICD-10 code definitions and the published sources of relative risk
estimates. As part of these discussions for alcohol we made contact with
the authors of the CRUK paper <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Brown2018" role="doc-biblioref">Brown et al.
2018</a>)</span>. Discussions focused particularly on the ICD-10
definitions of head and neck cancers, and oesophageal cancers. The
result of these discussions was an updated list of alcohol related
diseases for the Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model (SAPM) v4.0 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Angus2018" role="doc-biblioref">Angus et
al. 2018</a>)</span>. In producing our list of smoking related diseases
we sought to harmonise our ICD-10 definitions with those used in our
alcohol modelling. Our resulting list is mainly consistent with the RCP
report, with most deviations being for cancers, where we have been
influenced by CRUK’s work and our alcohol modelling. We explain the
choices we made in the report where we initially presented our disease
list <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Webster2018" role="doc-biblioref">Webster et al. 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The notable omissions from our list are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Breast cancer</em>—due to a small and statistically uncertain
effect of smoking;<br>
</li>
<li>
<em>Prostate cancer</em>—due to a lack of published evidence for
current smokers;<br>
</li>
<li>
<em>Ovarian cancer</em>—for which smoking only carries a risk for
fully malignant mucinous ovarian cancers (13% of ovarian cancers are
mucinous, and of these 57% are fully malignant), which made it difficult
to identify the cases attributable to smoking using the ICD-10
definitions recorded in mortality and hospital episode data.</li>
</ul>
<p>For oesophageal cancer, our discussions with CRUK concluded that we
should distinguish between adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC). However, it is not possible to distinguish these
subtypes from the routinely recorded ICD-10 codes. We therefore settled
on the following approach: We apportion overall oesophageal cancer
prevalence between AC and SCC using estimates of percentage prevalence
by age and sex shared with us by CRUK; these data are for 2014 for
England and derive from UK cancer registry on the number of oesophageal
SCCs.</p>

<h3 id="formersmokerrisk">Risk in former smokers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#formersmokerrisk"></a>
</h3>
<p>To estimate the risk of disease for former smokers we used the
findings of Kontis et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Kontis2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, who
re-analysed the change in risk after smoking in the ACS-CPS II study
from Oza et al.<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Oza2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>. Since Kontis et al. only provide
estimates for cancers, CVD or COPD, we had to decide how to specify the
rates of decline in the risks due to smoking after quitting for other
diseases. Kontis et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Kontis2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> consider
this issue for type II diabetes, stating that “Randomised trials also
indicate that the benefits of behaviour change and pharmacological
treatment on diabetes risk occur within a few years, more similar to the
CVDs than cancers <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Knowler2002" role="doc-biblioref">Knowler et al. 2002</a>)</span>. Therefore, we used
the CVD curve for diabetes.” In-line with Kontis et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Kontis2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, we apply the rate of decline in
risk of CVD after quitting smoking to type II diabetes.</p>
<p>We had to make further assumptions about how the risk due to smoking
declines after quitting for other diseases (these assumptions are under
review and their influence on model findings can be tested with
sensitivity analyses). Our default is to assume that the decline in risk
for all respiratory conditions follows Kontis et al.’s <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Kontis2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> estimates for COPD. For other
diseases, we might assume that the decline in relative risk follows the
cancer curve (the slowest decline in risk), that the additional risk
from smoking disappears immediately following quitting (the fastest
decline in risk), or that the risk immediately falls to the average risk
in former smokers identified from meta-analyses (potentially a
middle-ground option, although these estimates will be influenced by
differences in study design e.g. in average length of follow-up). The
default option in the current version of STPM is to apply the most
conservative option that the decline in risk for other diseases follows
the cancer curve.</p>
<p>To estimate the risk of disease in former smokers, they are initially
assigned the relative risk for each disease associated with current
smoking. This risk is then scaled downwards according to the time since
quitting, using the equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
RR_{former}=1+[RR_{current}-1][1-p(f)],
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>in which the relative risk (<span class="math inline">\(RR\)</span>)
associated with current smoking is scaled according to our estimates of
the proportional reduction in the risk (<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) associated with their number of years
(<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>) as a former smoker. After
someone has been quit for 40 years, we assume their risk reverts back to
be the same as a never smoker.</p>

<h2 id="tobaccoalcohol-interactions-in-disease-risk">Tobacco–Alcohol interactions in disease risk<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tobaccoalcohol-interactions-in-disease-risk"></a>
</h2>
<p>When we talk about tobacco-alcohol interactions in disease risk, what
we mean is that we want to account for any additional increase in risk
of disease that occurs for people who both smoke and drink alcohol. See
VanderWeele and Knol <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vanderweele2014tutorial" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> for an explanation of measures of
interaction. The rationale for considering this risk interaction is that
for some diseases there can be physiological interactions between
substances in alcoholic beverages and in tobacco smoke that mean that
when both alcohol and tobacco are consumed, then the disease-causing
effect of either one is greater.</p>
<p>In 2015, we conducted a scoping review across all diseases for which
tobacco and alcohol are causal factors to ascertain the extent of
evidence on interaction effects. We included only interactions with a
meta-analysis of effect size. The only diseases for which we found
suitable meta-analyses to inform the tobacco–alcohol interaction in risk
was cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx (for which we used
estimated of head and neck cancer overall: alcohol alone 1.06, tobacco
alone 2.37, tobacco and alcohol 5.73) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Hashibe2009" role="doc-biblioref">Hashibe et al.
2009</a>)</span>, and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) of the oesophagus
(alcohol alone 1.21, tobacco alone 1.36, alcohol and tobacco 3.28) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Prabhu2014" role="doc-biblioref">Prabhu,
Obi, and Rubenstein 2014</a>)</span>. Interactions estimated from odds
ratios were assumed to be equivalent to interactions estimated from
relative risks.</p>
<p>Prabhu et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Prabhu2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> reported interaction effects using
a metric of multiplicative interaction called the “Synergy Factor”. The
Synergy Factor gives the factor by which the relative risk of disease in
someone who both smokes and drinks (<span class="math inline">\(RR_{ta}\)</span>) exceeds the product of the
relative risks in someone who only smokes (<span class="math inline">\(RR_{t}\)</span>) and someone who only drinks
(<span class="math inline">\(RR_{a}\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\text{Synergy Factor} = \frac{RR_{ta}}{RR_t \times RR_a}.
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>In the STAPM modelling, interaction estimates from the literature are
applied on the additive rather than multiplicative scale by estimating a
metric called the “Synergy Index” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rothman1986" role="doc-biblioref">Rothman 1986.</a>)</span>.
The Synergy Index measures the extent to which the relative risk for
someone who both smokes and drinks exceeds 1, and whether this is
greater than the sum of the extent to which the relative risk of people
who only smoke or only drink exceeds 1:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\text{Synergy Index} = \frac{RR_{ta}-1}{(RR_t-1)+(RR_a-1)}.
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>For head and neck cancer overall, the Synergy Index is estimated to
be 3.09, and for oesophageal SCC the Synergy Index is 1.99.</p>
<p>Data on the synergistic effects of tobacco and alcohol risks are
stored in the package repository in the spreadsheet
<code>tobalcepi/vignettes/inst/tob_alc_interactions_180119.csv</code>
and as package data in
<code>tobalctobalcepi::tob_alc_risk_int</code>.</p>
<p>The interaction effects are applied in the STAPM modelling using the
functions <code><a href="../reference/RRFunc.html">tobalcepi::RRFunc()</a></code> and
<code><a href="../reference/TobAlcInt.html">tobalcepi::TobAlcInt()</a></code>. The function
<code><a href="../reference/TobAlcInt.html">tobalcepi::TobAlcInt()</a></code> contains code that calculates the
Synergy Index according to the above formula. The function
<code><a href="../reference/RRFunc.html">tobalcepi::RRFunc()</a></code> then combines the relative risks for
diseases that are related to both tobacco and alcohol using the additive
scale formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
RR_{ta} = 1 + \left[\left((RR_a - 1) + (RR_t - 1)\right) \times
\text{Synergy Index}\right].
