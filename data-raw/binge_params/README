The aim of this code is to process the parameters that allow the modelling of 
acute harms that are partially attributable to alcohol in STAPM

# This is the SAPM method
data_sapm_test <- tobalcepi::AlcBinge(data)

adapt the method to predict the number of drinking occassions 
and the distribution of amount consumed 
as a function of the average weekly amount of alcohol consumed, age, sex and IMD quintile. 

assign the parameter values from Hill-McManus et al. to each individual 
and then average these values by age, sex and IMD quintile 

the IMD quintile averages will then reflect the variation among IMD quintiles 
in the distribution of ethnicity, income, number of children etc.
