<p>Tobacco and alcohol are risk factors for a broad range of health conditions, but the relationship between smoking, drinking and some health conditions is complex. Whilst some conditions, such as alcohol liver disease, are caused solely by alcohol, there are other conditions for which alcohol is a contributory, but not the only, risk factor.</p>
<p>When the risk of having a health condition is increased by exposure to tobacco or alcohol consumption, but tobacco or alcohol consumption is not the only factor that increases risk, we refer to the burden of ill health from that condition as being “partially-attributable” to tobacco or alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Estimating the proportions of the health burden of conditions that are partially attributable to tobacco smoking and drinking alcohol is important for monitoring the impact of these commodities on society, e.g. for understanding the additional demand for healthcare services that is due to tobacco or alcohol consumption <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nhs2019statisticsALC" role="doc-biblioref">NHS Digital 2019a</a>, <a href="#ref-nhs2019statistics" role="doc-biblioref">2019b</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>These proportions, known generally as <em>Population Attributable Fractions</em> (PAFs) or specifically <em>Alcohol Attributable Fractions</em> (AAFs), <em>Smoking Attributable Fractions</em> (SAFs) or <em>Alcohol and Smoking Attributable Fractions</em> (ASAFs) (that define the joint burden of disease that is due to the combination of tobacco and alcohol consumption among individuals in society), are defined as the proportion of the cases of a partially attributable disease or injury that would be prevented if exposure to alcohol or tobacco was eliminated <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mansournia2018population" role="doc-biblioref">Mansournia and Altman 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-rosen2013intuitive" role="doc-biblioref">Rosen 2013</a>)</span>.</p>

</h3>
<p>The population attributable fraction (PAF) is the proportion by which the cases of a disease would be reduced if the population were not exposed to a certain factor. In our case, we define the exposure as either tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, or a combination of the two. The PAF is defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:pafbasic">\[\begin{equation}
PAF = \frac{A_{\text{exposed}}(h)}{A_{\text{total}}(h)} \tag{2.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(A_{exposed}(h)\)</span> is the number of individuals who have disease <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> because of the exposure, and <span class="math inline">\(A_{total}(h)\)</span> is the total number of people with disease <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. It should be obvious that for chronic diseases related to tobacco and alcohol, the number of individuals who have the disease in any year <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is strongly influenced by how their history of exposure to tobacco and alcohol consumption over many years has affected disease incidence, recovery, relapse and survival. However, it turns out that it is difficult to incorporate this complex chain of causality into PAF estimates. This means that when we consider the methodology of PAF calculation, part of our aim is to understand how our chosen method might bias the PAF estimates.</p>

<h3 id="the-commonly-used-formula">
<span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> The commonly used formula<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-commonly-used-formula"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are a range of alternative methods to calculate PAFs (e.g. see a comparison of methods for estimating smoking attributable fractions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Oza2011" role="doc-biblioref">Oza et al. 2011</a>)</span>). The method that we consider, which we term the “prevalence-based method”, is based on the use of cross-sectional survey data on tobacco and alcohol consumption. It does not make a direct link between an individual’s tobacco and alcohol consumption and their development of disease using these data. Instead, it makes use of published statistical estimates that show how the relative risk of disease varies with exposure to tobacco and alcohol consumption. It is commonly used to estimate the disease morbidity and mortality attributable to tobacco and alcohol consumption in England <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nhs2019statisticsALC" role="doc-biblioref">NHS Digital 2019a</a>, <a href="#ref-nhs2019statistics" role="doc-biblioref">2019b</a>; <a href="#ref-RCP2018" role="doc-biblioref">Tobacco Advisory Group of the Royal College of Physicians 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-jones2008alcohol" role="doc-biblioref">Jones et al. 2008</a>)</span>. It is defined for each disease as</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:pafmain">\[\begin{equation}
PAF = \frac{\sum_{u}\theta(u)[rr(u)-1]}{1+\sum_{u}\theta(u)[rr(u)-1]},\tag{2.2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is an index of exposure, which in our case might be defined in terms of current and past consumption of tobacco and/or alcohol, and <span class="math inline">\(rr\)</span> is the relative risk of disease. PAFs might be estimated using <a href="#eq:pafmain">(2.2)</a> separately for particular calendar years, ages or various definitions of population strata.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Bias notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Estimates will depend on the extent to which the survey data records each individual’s current and past tobacco and alcohol consumption, and most cross-sectional survey datasets have limited information on individual consumption histories.<br>
</li>
<li>Estimates also depend on the nature of the statistical estimates that link individual tobacco and alcohol consumption to their relative risk of disease. Meta-analyses are used where possible, but primary studies vary in influential factors such as: population context; how they have defined exposure to tobacco and alcohol; how they have defined disease end-points, e.g. incidence, prevalence or death; study design, e.g. cohort or case-control; and the factors controlled for in statistical analysis.</li>

<p>The population attributable fraction (PAF) is the proportion by which the cases of a disease would be reduced if the population were not exposed to a certain risk factor. In the STAPM modelling, the exposure considered is either only alcohol consumption, only tobacco smoking or a combination of the two.
When both alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking are considered, the population attributable fraction represents the proportion by which the cases of a disease would be reduced if the exposure of the population to the effects of both tobacco and alcohol consumption were removed. If this were to happen, then it would mean that people who both smoke and drink would have to stop both behaviours, and people who smoke but do not drink, and vice versa, would have to stop one behaviour.</p>
<p>It is commonly observed that the joint alcohol and smoking attributable fractions (ASAFs) are smaller than the sum of the single substance attributable fractions, the AAFs and SAFs. In general terms, this is because the substance specific attributable fractions combine to give the joint attributable fraction according to the formula <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mant1995detecting" role="doc-biblioref">Mant and Hicks 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-ezzati2003estimates" role="doc-biblioref">Ezzati et al. 2003</a>)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
ASAF = 1 – (1 - AAF) \times (1 – SAF)
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>According to this formula, if 20% of cases of a disease could be prevented by removing exposure to alcohol, and 20% of cases of the same disease could be prevented by removing exposure to tobacco smoke, then we would expect that 36% rather than 40% of cases of the disease would be prevented by removing exposure to both substances.</p>
<p>The reduction of the ASAF in relation to the sum of the single substance attributable fractions is larger when a larger proportion of the population both drink and smoke, i.e., when there is a larger positive correlation between individuals’ tobacco and alcohol consumption. The reduction of the ASAF in relation to the sum of the single substance attributable fractions implies that preventing some cases of a disease that is related to both tobacco and alcohol in people who consume both substances might necessitate the removal of the exposure to both tobacco and alcohol consumption, i.e. removing just one exposure is insufficient. However, the single substance AAFs and SAFs assume that removing exposure to just one substance is enough, without considering the competing effects of multiple exposures. The ASAF is therefore a more accurate estimate of the joint burden of disease <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ezzati2002selected" role="doc-biblioref">Ezzati et al. 2002</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In light of this, adjusted versions of the single substance attributable fractions can be calculated in which they are scaled downwards to approximate the cases of a disease related to both tobacco and alcohol that might be prevented if exposure to only one substance were removed.</p>
<p>Difference between the sum of the single substance attributable fractions and the joint attributable fraction:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
d = ((AAF + SAF) – ASAF).
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Adjusted single substance attributable fractions from which half of the above difference has been subtracted:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
AAF_{adjusted} = AAF – 0.5 \times d,
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
SAF_{adjusted} = SAF – 0.5 \times d.
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Using the adjusted single substance attributable fractions means that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
ASAF = AAF_{adjusted} + SAF_{adjusted}.
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Using the adjusted single substance attributable fractions can help to communicate the accumulated burden of disease from exposure to multiple risk factors.</p>
